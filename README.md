AI Vehicle Recommendation Tool (Irish Scenario)

This project uses cost assumptions and machine learning to recommend vehicles in Ireland based on a user's budget (the total budget, not just the downpayment or purchase price) and monthly driving distance. It predicts the 5-year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) using both rule-based and data-driven approaches.

*** How to Run the Project ***

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/AnanthuPSankar/DissertationDBS.git
cd DissertationDBS


Install required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib


Run the preprocessing pipeline:

python tco_calculate.py
python clean_dataset.py
python preprocess_dataset.py


Launch the recommender tool:

python recommendation_engine.py


Enter your inputs when prompted:

Budget (EUR)

Average monthly driving distance (in km)

View your recommended vehicles:

Affordable and stretch options are printed in the terminal

Recommendations are saved as CSV files with dynamic filenames

***** Features *****

Calculates realistic 5-year TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)

Irish market assumptions for energy, fuel, maintenance

Predictive ML model (Random Forest Regressor)

Dynamic user inputs (budget + distance)

Saves output for easy reporting and comparison

****  Irish Assumptions Used ****

Electricity: €0.34/kWh

Fuel (petrol/diesel): €1.75/L

Maintenance: €550/year (ICE), €350/year (EV)

Battery replacement: €7,000 (for EVs < 300 km range)

Depreciation: 35% over 5 years

Default driving: 15,000 km/year (modifiable)

**** Output Sample ****

Each run generates:

affordable_recommendations_budget<BUDGET>_km<MONTHLYKM>.csv

stretch_recommendations_budget<BUDGET>_km<MONTHLYKM>.csv
